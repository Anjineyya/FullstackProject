Full-Stack Document Management Application Overview
Backend (FastAPI):

Contains main.py to handle API requests for document upload, parsing, and NLP queries.
Dockerfile for containerizing the backend services.
requirements.txt lists dependencies such as FastAPI, PostgreSQL client, and NLP libraries.
Frontend (React.js):

App.js provides the user interface for uploading documents, querying via NLP, and viewing results.
package.json manages frontend dependencies and configurations.
A separate Dockerfile is used to build and serve the React frontend.
Database (PostgreSQL & Redis):

schema.sql defines the normalized database schema with foreign keys for efficient data management.
Redis is used for caching search results and session management to improve performance.
Document Storage & Parsing:

AWS S3 stores uploaded documents.
unstructured.io library extracts content and metadata from files (PDFs, PPTs, etc.).
NLP & Query Agents:

LangChain/LLamaIndex handles document indexing and advanced NLP queries.
RAG Agents retrieve and generate responses from indexed content.
Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes:

Backend and frontend are containerized using Docker.
Kubernetes YAML files (backend-deployment.yaml, frontend-deployment.yaml) manage deployments and scaling.
Monitoring and Logging (Optional):

Prometheus collects metrics, and Grafana visualizes them on dashboards.
ELK Stack aggregates logs for troubleshooting and analysis.
Authentication & Security:

JWT or session-based authentication secures user interactions and document access.
Scalability & Reliability:

Kubernetes ensures high availability, and Redis improves response time with caching.
Documentation:

The README.md provides setup instructions and deployment steps, along with an architecture diagram for easy understanding.
